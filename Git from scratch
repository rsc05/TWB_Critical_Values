Git from scratch

I assume you have done the configiration so no configiration needed

Nevigate to this folder of interest to put it on git

cd '/c/Users/Rami New/Desktop/Website/Hello World/MyWebPage'

Create this as repository

git init


git status

nothing to commit yet

this is because there is no file in it. create a file and name it whatever you please

git add --all
git status

git commit -m 'My first Matlab commit'


 importing an existing repository.

Push something to github

First we need to set origin

git remote add origin https://github.com/rsc05/TWB_Critical_Values.git

where we are pushing
git remote -v

git push origin master

pull 
git clone https://github.com/rsc05/TWB_Critical_Values.git


if you do anychanges and want to save it to git hub

simply write 
git status

then 
git add -A

git commit -m 'Did little changes to git'

git push origin master
